    "\n",
    "Evaluating the model to determine how it is behaving and whether it's improved is the most important thing.  To do that effectively you need to look at the data, a lot.  So you need this to be as frictionless as possible.  There are many eval frameworks out there.  If I were to pick one to use I would choose [inspect_ai](https://ukgovernmentbeis.github.io/inspect_ai/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, I recommend using [Shiny for Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/) to build a custom web app to build your own custom eval UI.  I believe evals to be the most important part of the process and it is always very specific to the use-case and so I believe the flexibility here is worth it.  You cannot just use generic evals that are applied to every problem and be successfull.  Shiny for python lets me create exactly what I need and bring in any relevant data, context, test results, etc. in the exact format I need.  I highly recommend the core version and not the express version.\n"

    "+ **Chain of Thought (CoT):** Ask the model to think through and explan a problem before answering the question.\n",
    "+ **Few Shot:**  Add examples to your prompt.  Especially ones the model gets wrong.\n",

    "+ **Text**:  Texts that are relevant to the ask, such as a paragraph or a page from a reference article.\n",
    "+ **Code**:  Code or functions that are relevant to the ask\n",
