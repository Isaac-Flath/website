    "## Why Conda?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages in `conda` have explicit dependencies.  That means that when you install a package `conda` will automatically install its dependencies. This can save you a lot of time and headaches when working on complex projects with many dependencies. For example, installing `PyTorch` with `conda` will automatically install all the necessary dependencies, without the need to install them separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling non-Python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` is a very common tool similar to `conda` used in python, but `pip` is more limited.  `pip` is python only and can only handle python dependencies and if there are non python dependencies it cannot manage those for you. `conda` on the other hand can handle dependencies of any language.  For example, `pytorch` has non-python dependencies for cuda that cannot be handled by `pip` but `conda` can.  This makes installation and maintaining the installation much simpler with `conda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isolation of Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda` gives you the the ability to create isolated environments. This allows you to have different versions of packages and dependencies for different projects without them interfering with each other."

    "To get started with conda, you will first need to install it on your system. You can download the appropriate installer for your operating system from the Miniconda website (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Miniconda is a lightweight version of the Anaconda distribution, which includes only the conda package manager. Miniconda is what I recommend using and what this guide will cover, though many install the larger Anaconda that include conda as a part of it.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Managing Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda allows you to create and manage multiple environments, and switch between them as needed. This can be useful when working on different projects, or when different projects require different versions of the same package.  In conda you are always working within an environment so let's start with the basic commands to manage environments.\n"
