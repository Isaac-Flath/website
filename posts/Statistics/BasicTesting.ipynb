    "In [a previous post](../TimeSeries/SimpleTimeSeries.ipynb) we created models and created actions we want to take for multiple approaches for stock trading.  The question now is, how do we know if they are profitable?  How should we measure them?  How do we know if we simply got lucky, or if they are reliable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is the most important part of the process.  If done well you have a good way to determine what strategies should be implemented, and if done poorly you run the risk of implementing non-profitable strategies.  I believe you should strive to never sacrifice testing principles because effective testing is your **only** objective indication to whether you are doing something useful or not.  Without effective testing you are \"flying blind\".\n",

    "The Test set is very similar to the validation set, but it takes things a step further.  It has further restrictions in that is is the final model step before deployment.  The main difference is how often you can use it.  For the validation set, you can test anything on the validation set as many times as you want.  For the test set you only get to look at the test set once for your particular approach.\n",

    "For example, you may try 300 different approaches and parameter changes to your strategy to see what works best.  You can check the profitability on each of them using the validation set.  Then once you have chosen a strategy, you do a final check to ensure it also performs on the test set.  Once you have done that you need a new test set or your project is over.\n",

    "Statistical testing can be done be done using 2 general approaches.  The first is the classical approach with is the most widely known.  The second is through bootstrapping.  This post will focus on bootstrapping because in my opinion it is the first that should be learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is less commonly accepted but is the more powerful and flexible of the two.  In bootstrapping you create a sampling distribution by by taking many samples and performing an experiment.  In traditional testing you use clever algebra to approximate a sampling distribution.  With todays computer you can almost always use bootstrapping and I believe it it the more powerful and flexible approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Bootstrapping you start with just the data and make no other assumptions about the data.  With classical methods you start with the data and some assumptions about the data in order to arrive at an answer.  If you make incorrect assumptions then you get an incorrect answer - and determining which assumptions are safe to make is not always trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of bootstrapping and the power of it has also been spoken of by many of the statistical greats for almost 100 years, much longer than it was feasible to do, [as pointed out in this article](https://www.lock5stat.com/Lock5Overview.pdf).\n",

    "That said, I do believe it's good and useful to have the ability to use both approaches.  Luckily, traditional testing is just algebraic tricks to approximate what we will do here and so it will not be too hard to pick that up on top of bootstrapping.  In this section we will focus on Bootstrapping because in my opinion it is the one that should be learned first."
