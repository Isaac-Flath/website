## Problem Description

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.  You cannot convert to string.

### tests

```{python}
def test(fn):
    value = 121
    expected = True
    actual = fn(value)
    assert actual == expected 

    value = -121
    expected = False
    actual = fn(value)
    assert actual == expected 

    value = 10
    expected = False
    actual = fn(value)
    assert actual == expected 

    value = 12321
    expected = True
    actual = fn(value)
    assert actual == expected 

    value = 123214231
    expected = False
    actual = fn(value)
    assert actual == expected 
```


## Solutions

### String Index

The first thought is that we could cast to a string then loop halfway through the string to verify the first and laft halves are the same.

Time complexity: `O(n)`
Space Complexity: `O(1)`

```{python}
def isPalindrome(x: int) -> bool:
    x = str(x)
    for i in range(len(x)//2):
        first, last = x[i], x[-(i+1)]
        if first != last: return False
    return True

test(isPalindrome)
```

### Math 

Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

+ Time Complexity: `O(log10(n))`
+ Space Complexity: `O(1)`

```{python}
def isPalindrome(x: int) -> bool:
    if x < 0: # A negative sign means not a palindrome
        return False 
    if (x != 0) and (x % 10 == 0): # Int has no leading zeros, so if it ends with 0 it's not a palindrome
        return False  

    numberHalf = 0
    while x > numberHalf: # Stop once halfway
        # Add the rightmost number from x to number half
        numberHalf = int(numberHalf * 10 + x % 10)
        # Drop the rightmost number on X
        x//= 10

    # If odd length drop the right most as that is the center number
    return x == numberHalf or x == numberHalf//10 

test(isPalindrome)

```
