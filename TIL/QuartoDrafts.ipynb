    "With a bash command I can search for all files recursively that contain \"draft: true\".  THis gives me all my drafts, and I don't have to worry about losing them or keeping them in a separate place.\n",

    "+ `find . -type f -print0`:  Finds all the file names recursively\n",
    "+ `|` : Takes the output of the left and inputs it into the right\n",
    "+ `xargs -0` : Processes the input file names to pass into grep\n",
    "+ `grep -l \"draft: true\"`: Grep searches each file for \"draft: true\".  `-l` has it return the file name associated with positive matches.\n",

    "### Excluding Files\n",
    "If you're getting some files you don't want, you can add exclusion criteria.  For example if you add `| grep -v \".ipynb_checkpoints\"` to the end, it will exclude notebook checkpoints that you almost certainly don't want to see!\n",
