## Problem Description

Given a string s containing just the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

+ Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
+ Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
+ Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.


Constraints:

+ `1 <= s.length <= 104`
+ `s` consists of parentheses only `()[]{}`.


### tests

```{python}
def test(fn):
    s = "()"
    expected = True
    assert fn(s) == expected 

    s = "()[]{}"
    expected = True
    assert fn(s) == expected 

    s= "(]"
    expected = False
    assert fn(s) == expected 
```


## Solution

+ Time Complexity: `O(n)`
+ Space Complexity: `O(n)`

```{python}
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    enclosures = {')':'(','}':'{',']':'['}
    stack = []

    for c in s:

        # If it's an closing bracket
        if c in enclosures:

            # Validate stack exists and bracket order is correct
            if stack and stack[-1] == enclosures[c]:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return False
        else:
            # If it's an opening bracket
            stack.append(c)

    # If stack isn't empty then an enclosure isn't closed
    return not stack 

test(isValid)    


```
