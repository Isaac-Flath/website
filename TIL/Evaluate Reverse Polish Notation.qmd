## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:

+ The valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
+ Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
+ The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
+ There will not be any division by zero.
+ The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
+ The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.

### tests

```{python}
def test(fn):
    tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
    assert 9 == fn(tokens)

    tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
    assert 6 == fn(tokens)

    tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
    assert 22 == fn(tokens)

```


## Solution

+ Time Complexity: `O(n)`
+ Space Complexity: `O(n)`

```{python}
from typing import List
from operator import add, mul, sub, truediv
def evalRPN(tokens: List[str]) -> int:
    stack = []
    # Map each valid operator to a callable
    operators = {'+': add, '*': mul, '-': sub, '/': lambda x,y: int(truediv(x,y))}
    
    for t in tokens:
        # For every operator in tokens calculate res of last 2 with that operator
        if t in operators:
            f,s = stack.pop(),stack.pop()
            stack.append(operators[t](s,f))
        else:
            # if it's not an operator add the value to the stack
            stack.append(int(t))
    return stack.pop() # Last value remaining is the answer

test(evalRPN)
```
