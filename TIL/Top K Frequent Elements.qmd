## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.


### tests

```{python}
def test(fn):
    nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3] 
    k = 2    
    expected =  [1,2]
    actual = fn(nums,k)
    assert actual == expected 

    nums = [1]
    k = 1   
    expected =  [1]
    actual = fn(nums,k)
    assert actual == expected 

```


## Solution

+ Time Complexity: `O(n)`
+ Space Complexity: `O(n)`

```{python}
from typing import List
def topKFrequent(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]: 
    hashmap = {}
    for num in nums:
        # Get a hashmap of counts for each item in num
        hashmap[num] = 1 + hashmap.get(num,0)

    buckets = [[] for _ in range(len(nums)+1)]
    for key,val in hashmap.items():
        # Put nums in a list where index location == occurances
        buckets[val].append(key)

    output = []
    for i in range(len(buckets) - 1, 0, -1):
        # Loop through buckets backward and append to output
        for num in buckets[i]:
            output.append(num)
            if len(output) == k:
                # When you have k nums you are done
                return output

test(topKFrequent)

```
