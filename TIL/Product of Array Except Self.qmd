## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array answer such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

### tests

```{python}
def test(fn):
    nums = [1,2,3,4]
    expected =  [24,12,8,6]
    actual = fn(nums)
    assert actual == expected

    nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3] 
    expected = [0,0,9,0,0]
    actual = fn(nums)
    assert actual == expected
```


## Solution

+ Time Complexity: `O(n)`
+ Space Complexity: `O(1)`

```{python}
from typing import List
def productExceptSelf(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    prefix, postfix = 1,1
    out = [1] * len(nums)
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        out[i] = prefix
        prefix *= nums[i]

    for i in range(len(nums)-1,-1,-1):
        out[i] *= postfix
        postfix *= nums[i]
    return out

test(productExceptSelf)
    
```
