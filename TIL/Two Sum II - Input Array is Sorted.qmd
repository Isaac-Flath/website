## Problem Description

Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

### tests

```{python}
def test(fn):
    numbers = [2,7,11,15]
    target = 9
    expected = (1,2)
    assert fn(numbers,target) == expected 

    numbers = [2,3,4]
    target = 6
    expected = (1,3)
    assert fn(numbers,target) == expected 

    numbers = [-1,0]
    target = -1
    expected = (1,2)
    assert fn(numbers,target) == expected 
```


## Solution

+ Time Complexity: `O(1)`
+ Space Complexity: `O(n)`

```{python}
from typing import List
def twoSum(numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    # start at each end of the list
    i1, i2 = 0, len(numbers) - 1

    while i1 < i2:
        curr_sum = numbers[i1] + numbers[i2]

        if curr_sum < target: # If too small
            i1 += 1 # make it bigger
        elif curr_sum > target: # If too big
            i2 -= 1 # make it smaller
        else:
            return i1+1, i2+1 # if juuussstt right

test(twoSum)
```
