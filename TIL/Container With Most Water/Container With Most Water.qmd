## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

### tests

```{python}
def test(fn):
    height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    expected =  49
    actual = fn(height)
    assert actual == expected 

    height = [1,1]
    expected = 1
    actual = fn(height)
    assert actual == expected 

```

## Solution

-   Time Complexity: `O(n)`
-   Space Complexity: `O(1)`

```{python}
from typing import List
def maxArea(height: List[int]) -> int:
    l,r = 0, len(height)-1 # start at each end
    maxV = 0

    # Iterate through half, so you stop when pointers meet somewhere in middle
    while l < r:
        lh, rh = height[l],height[r]

        # calculate current area and keep if bigger
        maxV = max(maxV, (r-l) * min(lh,rh))

        # move pointer on smallest side
        if lh < rh:
            l+=1
        else:
            r-=1
    return maxV
test(maxArea)
```
