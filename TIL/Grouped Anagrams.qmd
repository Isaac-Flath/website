## Problem Description

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### tests

```{python}
def test(fn):
    strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
    expected =  [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]

    actual = fn(strs)
    assert sorted(actual) == sorted(expected)



```


## Solution

+ Time Complexity: `O(m * n)`
+ Space Complexity: `O(n)`

Where `m` is the average length of the strings in `strs`, and `n` is the length of `strs`

```{python}
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
    grouped_anagrams = defaultdict(list) 

    for s in strs:
        # key[0] represents a, key[1] represents b, etc.
        # key is an array of character counts
        key = [0]*26 
        for c in s:
            # use unicode to calculate index location in key that corresponds to c and increment
            key[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1

        # list can't be key, so convert key to tuple for usage with dict
        grouped_anagrams[tuple(key)].append(s)

    return grouped_anagrams.values()

test(groupAnagrams)
```
