## Problem Description

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition. 
1. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition. 
1. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition. 

**Note:**

+ A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable. 
+ Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]

```

### tests

```{python}
def test(fn):
    board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
            ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
            ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
            ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
            ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
            ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
            ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
            ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
            ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
    expected = True
    actual = fn(board)
    assert actual == expected 

    board = [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
            ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
            ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
            ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
            ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
            ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
            ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
            ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
            ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
    expected = False
    actual = fn(board)
    assert actual == expected 

```

## Solution

-   Time Complexity: `O(n)`
-   Space Complexity: `O(n)`

Where `n` in the number of cells on the sudoku board.

```{python}
from typing import List
def isValidSudoku(board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
    # Initialize sets to track if there's duplicate values
    rowSet = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    colSet = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    gridSet = [set() for _ in range(9)]

    # for each cell in matrix
    for rowIndex in range(0,9):
        for colIndex in range(0,9):
            cellValue = board[rowIndex][colIndex]
            if cellValue == ".": continue

            # Calculate the grid index number
            gridIndex = rowIndex//3*3 + colIndex //3

            # if cell value is already in set for row/col/grid
            if (cellValue in rowSet[rowIndex] or
                cellValue in colSet[colIndex] or 
                cellValue in gridSet[gridIndex]): 
                # Then there's a duplicate and it's not valid
                return False

            # Otherwise add to the set and go to the next cell
            rowSet[rowIndex].add(cellValue)
            colSet[colIndex].add(cellValue)
            gridSet[gridIndex].add(cellValue)
    # If you make it through all cells with no dupes, then it's valid
    return True

test(isValidSudoku)
