## Problem Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

### tests

```{python}
def test(fn):
    val1, val2 = 1,100
    expected =  9

    actual = fn(low,high)
    assert actual == expected 

```


## Solution

+ Time Complexity: `O(n)`
+ Space Complexity: `O(n)`

```{python}
from typing import List

def longestConsecutive(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    numset = set(nums)
    max_seq_len = 0

    for num in nums:

        # if beginning of a sequence
        if num-1 not in numset:
            seq_start = num
            seq_length = 1
            
            # Keep incrementing values until you're at end of sequence
            while seq_start + 1 in numset:
                seq_length += 1
                seq_start += 1
            
            # Keep sequence length if it's the longest so far
            max_seq_len = max(max_seq_len, seq_length)
    return max_seq_len
```
