## Problem Description

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

### tests

```{python}
def test(fn):
    height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
    actual = 6
    assert actual == fn(height) 

    height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
    actual = 9
    assert actual == fn(height) 

```

## Solution

-   Time Complexity: `O(n)`
-   Space Complexity: `O(1)`

```{python}
from typing import List
def trap(height: List[int]) -> int:
    l,r = 0, len(height)-1 # start on both ends
    vol = 0
    lm, rm = height[l], height[r]
    
    while l < r: # stop when pointers meet

        # The side with largest max determines the bin depth
        if lm < rm: 
            l += 1
            lm = max(height[l], lm)
            vol += lm - height[l] 
        else:
            r -= 1 
            rm = max(height[r], rm) 
            vol += rm - height[r]
    return vol

test(trap)
```
