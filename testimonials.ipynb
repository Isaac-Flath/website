His passion for knowledge and practical skills across many aspects of the data/analytics/data sciences realm has made him one of the most well-rounded data practitioners I have worked with. He brings a perspective that continuously feels unique yet is grounded in a practicality that always yields results. There are many aspects of his skill, knowledge, and personality I could speak highly of, but feel I can summarize it best by saying if I had to pick one individual to assist me in tackling an unknown data-related problem/engagement, large or small, it would probably be Isaac.\n",

What makes Isaac exceptional is his genuine interest and curiosity in understanding the “why” behind each project. This voluntary effort enables Isaac to bring innovative ideas and approaches to each initiative that routinely enable outcomes to be better than originally imagined. Isaac is also a joy to work with which is critically important for those working in remote or hybrid environments.  \n",

His analytics and data sciences chops are top notch, but his ability to combine technical expertise with a deep understanding of people and process to prescribe - and build - the optimal full stack solution is where he stands heads and shoulders above the rest of the pack.

He is able to walk me through things I don’t understand and explain them in effective way, while also showing me the path to go above and beyond.  Often these new directions are ones I never would have discovered myself.  This has been true while working under him in a professional setting as well as when discussing ideas and techniques while working alongside him on personal projects. The selfless support he shows his friends may is as impressive as the initiative and drive he shows in his own work.  I am truly excited to see what Isaac achieves in the future!\n",

He is able to get to the pertinent details of a project in a professional and timely manner, and reliably delivers quality results.
