    "Thanks a lot for your very detailed explanation @Isaac.Flath . I asked because I don't know how to organize a little bit more for my blogs ( by topics and when I click on it will show every post on this topic). I just found out about this blog https://ohmeow.com/  and it's great. Even if I can not do what I intended, I can always write a list of related post, like what he did here: https://ohmeow.com/posts/2022/03/31/ajtfb-chapter-8.html\n",
