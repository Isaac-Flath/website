If I didn't know, I wouldn't have realized is was using AI\n",

You paint a fake Monet and I will determine whether it's a real Monet or a fake.  Who do you think will be more competent at their task?  Clearly painting the Monet is the much harder job.\n",

    "\n",
    "A conditional GAN is where you can tell it what kind of image you want.  For example if you are generating different dog breeds, you tell the GAN you want a specific breed (ie Golden Retriever).  The way this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Generator is given a specific class to generate data for.\n",
    "1. The Critic determines whether is is real or fake data for that class.  For example rather than \"Predict if this is a real dog or not\" it's \"Predict if this is a real golden retriever or not\".  In order to fool the critic, the generator now has to not just create a dog - but the right species of dog.  The generator could predict a perfect image of a pitbull, but it would be easy for the critic to determine that it's a not a real golden retriever as pitbulls look completely different!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Controllable GANs\n",
    "\n",
    "A Controllable GAN allows you to control different aspects of the image.  For example, I want to be able to take an image and tell it to generate the same image but add a beard.  Or generate the same image but make the person look older.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A bit of background and how it's accomplished:  A generator creates data from random noise vectors.  These random noise vectors can be thought of as random seeds in a sense.  If I give the generator the exact same vector of random numbers, it will generate the exact same data.  So those random number translate to output features in the data, so you can figure out how they map and then tweak away! \n",
